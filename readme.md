<h1>Calendar</h1>
	<p>An attempt to clearly define a calendar by the first principles and astronomy.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<h3>First Level Definitions</h3>
		<p>These are the first-level definitions, based on astronomical events:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Era</dt><dd>an era begins with when the start of the year coincides with the start of the month on a solar eclipse, to the next.</dd>
			<dt>Year</dt><dd>a year begins with the start of the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere to the next.</dd>
			<dt>Month</dt><dd>a month begins with the start of a new moon to the next.</dd>
			<dt>Date</dt><dd>a date begins at the stroke of midnight, to the next.</dd>
		</dl>
	<h3>Second Level Definitions</h3>
		<p>These are second-level definitions, based on astronomical events and human convenience:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Solar Day</dt><dd>a solar day (day) begins at sunrise to the next sunset.</dd>
			<dt>Solar Night</dt><dd>a solar night (night) begins from sunset to the next sunrise.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>These are second-level definitions, based on astronomical events:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Lunar Day</dt><dd>a lunar day begins at moonrise to the next moonset.</dd>
			<dt>Lunar Night</dt><dd>a lunar night begins at moonset to the next moonrise.</dd>
		</dl>
	<h3>Third Level Definitions</h3>
		<p>These are the third-level definitions, based on convenience for everyday human use:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Hour</dt><dd>a unit of time a twelfth of the average day or the average night.</dd>
			<dt>Minute</dt><dd>from Latin: <em>pars minuta prima</em>, the first small part. a unit of time a sixtieth of an hour.</dd>
			<dt>Second</dt><dd>from Latin: <em>pars minuta secunda</em>, the second small part. a unit of time a sixtieth of a minute.</dd>
			<dt>Third</dt><dd>from Latin: <em>pars minuta tiertia</em>, the thrid small part. a unit of time a sixtieth of a second.</dd>
			<li>and so on</li>
		</dl>
		<p>Note: due to better time measurements, we have been able to measure that the third level definitions would not be constant if we define them by astronomical events of the average day/night. Practically, the duration of the hour would be defined as <em>33093474372000 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom</em>, with a new definition to be planned by the GCWM.</p>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
	<p>The hierarchy of the calendar is as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Era</li>
		<li>Year</li>
		<li>Month</li>
		<li>Date</li>
		<li>Hour</li>
		<li>Minute</li>
		<li>Second</li>
		<li>Third</li>
		<li>â€¦</li>
	</ol>
