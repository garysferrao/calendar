<h1>Calendar</h1>
	<p>An attempt to clearly define a calendar by the first principles and astronomy.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
	<h3>First Level Definitions</h3>
		<p>These are the first-level definitions, based on astronomical events:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Era</dt><dd>an era begins with when the start of the year coincides with the start of the month on a solar eclipse, to the next.</dd>
			<dt>Year</dt><dd>a year begins with the start of the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere to the next.</dd>
			<dt>Month</dt><dd>a month begins with the start of a new moon to the next.</dd>
			<dt>Date</dt><dd>a date begins at the stroke of midnight, to the next.</dd>
		</dl>
	<h3>Second Level Definitions</h3>
		<p>These are second-level definitions, based on astronomical events and human convenience:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Solar Day</dt><dd>a solar day (day) begins at sunrise to the next sunset.</dd>
			<dt>Solar Night</dt><dd>a solar night (night) begins from sunset to the next sunrise.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>These are second-level definitions, based on astronomical events:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Lunar Day</dt><dd>a lunar day begins at moonrise to the next moonset.</dd>
			<dt>Lunar Night</dt><dd>a lunar night begins at moonset to the next moonrise.</dd>
		</dl>
	<h3>Third Level Definitions</h3>
		<p>These are the third-level definitions, based on convenience for everyday human use:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Hour</dt><dd>a unit of time a twelfth of the average day or the average night.</dd>
			<dt>Minute</dt><dd>from Latin: <em>pars minuta prima</em>, the first small part. a unit of time a sixtieth of an hour.</dd>
			<dt>Second</dt><dd>from Latin: <em>pars minuta secunda</em>, the second small part. a unit of time a sixtieth of a minute.</dd>
			<dt>Third</dt><dd>from Latin: <em>pars minuta tiertia</em>, the thrid small part. a unit of time a sixtieth of a second.</dd>
			<li>and so on</li>
		</dl>
		<p>Note: due to better time measurements, we have been able to measure that the third level definitions would not be constant if we define them by astronomical events of the average day/night. Practically, the duration of the hour would be defined as <em>33093474372000 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom</em>, with a new definition to be planned by the GCWM.</p>

<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
	<p>The hierarchy of the calendar is as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Era</li>
		<li>Year</li>
		<li>Month</li>
		<li>Date</li>
		<li>Hour</li>
		<li>Minute</li>
		<li>Second</li>
		<li>Third</li>
		<li>â€¦</li>
	</ol>
<hr />

<h2>Counting</h2>
	<p>An hours is the fundamental unit of time, with the definition as mentioned.</p>
	<p>A year is counted at the time (moment) of the northern hemisphere winter solstice. The year numbering begins at 0, and increments at each time of a winter solstice.</p>
	<p>A month is counted at the time (moment) of a new moon. The month is counted at the moment of a new moon, but will reset to the 0 month at the moment of a new year (marking the progress of the yet incomplete month, for counting the months that belongs to the year). Optionally, months can be counted consecutively from the epoch new moon for ease in calculations and accountings.</p>
	<p>A day is provisionally measured according to the Indian Standard Time, until a more suitable prime meridian is decided. The day is counted at the moment of the mid-night, but will reset to the 0 day at the moment of a new month (marking the progress of the yet incomplete day, for counting the days that belongs to the month).</p>
	<h3>The Sapiens Era Calendar</h3>
		<p>The Sapiens Era Calendar started at the epoch of the nearest co-incidence of a very new moons (that was accompanied by a solar eclipse) and a winter solstice of the northern hemisphere.</p>
